## The Most Powerful JMstack CMS Made with Angular is Serverless and API-less! 💪

## 🔥 **What is Serverless?** 🚀

Serverless is a cloud computing model where you don't manage servers. Instead, you pay only for specific functions that
execute in response to events.

### **Advantages of Serverless:**

- **Automatic Scalability**: Functions scale automatically based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: You pay only for the execution time of your functions, not for idle servers.
- **Less Maintenance**: No need to worry about server infrastructure maintenance.

## 🌐 **What is API-less Architecture?** 🤔

API-less architecture focuses on building applications without directly interacting with APIs for every piece of
functionality. Instead, it may rely on static data or built-in functions and services. This can simplify development and
reduce dependencies on external systems.

### **Benefits of API-less Architecture:**

- **Simpler Development**: Fewer dependencies and reduced complexity.
- **Faster Execution**: Eliminates the need for API calls, which can speed up performance.
- **Reduced Costs**: Fewer external services may mean lower operational costs.

## 🎉 **How Do JAMstack and Serverless Relate?**

JAMstack and Serverless complement each other perfectly. While JAMstack focuses on a modern, fast frontend architecture,
Serverless handles backend logic seamlessly without the need for server management. Together, they provide a robust and
efficient solution for building web applications and sites.

## 🛠️ **How to Use BYLICMS**

### **1. Setting Up Your Environment**

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

```bash
# install byli cli globally
npm install byli@^1.0.4 -g
```

### **2. Creating a New BYLI CMS Project 🆕**

```bash
byli init
# if you have problems with the installation, try with 
npm exec byli init
```
Now you will see the following directory structure:

```bash
-- cms
    |-- app
    |-- cms
    |---- images
    |---- *.md
-- app
    |-- src
    |-- package.json
    |-- angular.json
    |-- ...
```
To this point, you have created a new BYLI CMS project with the default structure. You can now start adding your content to the `cms` directory, and refreshing the app with `byli refresh`.


### **3. Running Your BYLI CMS Project 🚀**

```bash
cd ./app
npm install
ng serve
```

### **4. Markdown needed metadata 📝**
When creating a new markdown file, you need to add the following metadata at the beginning of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "BYLICMS - The Most Powerful JAMstack CMS Made with Angular is Serverless and API-less!"
author: "Ignacio Lopez"
